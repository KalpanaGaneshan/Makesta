typealias PhotoTakingHelperCallback = UIImage? -> Void //Using the typealias keyword we can provide a function signature with a name. In this case we are saying that a function of type PhotoTakingHelperCallback has one parameter (a UIImage?) and returns Void. This means that any function that wants to be the callback of the PhotoTakingHelper needs to have exactly this signature.

    weak var viewController: UIViewController! //viewController, stores a weak reference to a UIViewController. As we discussed earlier, this reference is necessary because the PhotoTakingHelper needs a UIViewController on which it can present other view controllers. It is a weak reference because the PhotoTakingHelper does not own the referenced view controller.
    var callback: PhotoTakingHelperCallback //store the callback function
    var imagePickerController: UIImagePickerController?//provide a property to store a UIImagePickerController (which we will use a little bit later).
